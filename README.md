We all know, how challenging it is to find the job that meets all your expectations and requirements. LinkedIn is one of the largest job portals which connects job seekers to recruiters throughout the globe. There are innumerable jobs in various industries, but in order to find the job based on an individual's requisites, it obligates the need for one, to make seperate searches. In order to identify and tag the specific requirements for targeted searches, we bring to you **Savitar, a Chrome Extension** that helps you summarize a linkedin job posting so you dont have to spend your time reading through job descriptions that may not be relevant to you!

## What we completed in phase 2
* Replaced dummy data of badges with actual realtime data using string parsing and obtaining data from the body of linkedln pages.
* Expanded the functionality of project by adding fileds like "Years of experience", "Sponsorship", "Domain", etc.
* Completed integrating the Chrome extension with LinkedIn.
* Added Unit Tests for Javascript related part of the project.
* Added browser testing using Selenium for verifying html part of code.

## Project Set up
* add project setup instructions here.

# Phase 3

## Hypothesis
* With the help of this chrome extention, one can speed up the job filering process on linkdln by 70 percent!!!

## Experimental setup for quantitative evaluation of our project
### Goal
To compare the time one takes to decide to apply for a given job on linkedln with and withput using savitar.

### Experiment
* Take a two similar job descriptions from Linkedln.
* Pick your favourite person and show them one of the job description.
* Without using savitar, ask them to make decision on if they want to apply for givrn job or not. Record the time taken to make this decision.
* Now, using savitar, again ask them to make the decision for the other job profile. Again, record the time.
* Now compare both the times.

* Repeat this experiment with more number of jobs and for more number of people.
* Analyse and compare the timing data statistically to verify the hypothesis.
